"""
    Generate a CSV file for loading the file into a PostGres database

        Two axes in age and gender
        A code list (code, description)

        Number of patients
        Each encounter gets a number

    The data should fit a null model that would be an unrealistic representation
        (e.g., a 2 year old male with a pregnancy)

        Here the null model assumes that a diagnosis on any given date within the period
        Any code could be generated
